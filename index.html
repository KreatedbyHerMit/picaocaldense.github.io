  <h1>About</h1>
  <div><p>Growing up as a first-generation Canadian, my life has been a beautiful blend of two worlds. Though I was born and raised in Canada, my heart has always been deeply connected to Colombia—my country of heritage. Embracing my Colombian roots has been my way of honoring my family’s story and culture. Through language, traditions, and stories passed down, I found a bridge between my upbringing and my ancestry.</p>

<p>This connection has shaped who I am today, allowing me to celebrate my heritage while thriving at home. My journey is a testament to the strength and richness that comes from embracing both cultures.</p>
